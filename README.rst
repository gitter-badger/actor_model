Introduction to the Actor Model of Computation
==============================================

This repository hosts slides and code for a brief introduction to the
Actor Model of Computation.


Slides
------

The slides are generated from the IPython notebook
`Introduction.ipynb`_ (it can be viewed online, but needs to run to
generate the HTML slides).

Code
----

The module that implements a minimal actor language is `tartpy`_.  The
examples and instructions to install are in the IPython notebook `Examples.ipynb`_.

References

This is a list of references mentioned in the slides and examples,
plus some other miscellanea material, in no order, with some comments.

+ **Gul Agha**. *Actors: A Model of Concurrent Computation in 
  Distributed Systems*. Doctoral Dissertation. 1986.
    
  A comprehensive book with good details on patterns. It discusses an
  operational model.

  More mathematical, but good discussions on configurations and
  composability.

  A good overview of many topics, including a very big list of
  references (which is a superset of this list).

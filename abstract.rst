Introduction to the Actor Model of Computation
----------------------------------------------

Concurrency, parallelism, and distributed systems are big trends in
the world of computing nowadays.  The Actor Model is a mathematical
theory, extending classical computations, that allow us to reason and
to implement these kinds of systems.  We will introduce the
fundamentals of this theory and we will move quickly to practical uses
of actors.  Common patterns of distributed systems will be expressed
using actors, which helps in understanding the theory at a deeper
level.

Although we will discuss important fundamental notions for distributed
systems (such as unbounded nondeterminism), the presentation is aimed
to be pragmatic in nature.  We will show running code using Python,
readily available to the audience for playing and experimenting.  The
slides and code are hosted at:
